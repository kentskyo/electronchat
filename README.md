A minimal electron app using openai's chat api. For more detail on the implementation check out the post on kentskyo.

To run you'll need [an api key from openai.](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

## To Use

```
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/kentskyo/electronchat.git
cd electronchat
npm install
npm run start
```

Then click on the key icon to enter your API key, and click it again to store. Chat away!
